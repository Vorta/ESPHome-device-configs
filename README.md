# ESPHome device configs
Collection of configuration files for running ESPHome on different devices.

## Reason
Whenever I get a new device finding a configuration that works for it is difficult.
I usually have to mix and match different parts of config files from different sites
or forums. Here I'm storing the config file "masters" that I am using with my Home
Assistant and ESPHome instance

## Contributing
Feel free to add config files for your devices that you are using.
Make sure that `device_class`, `state_class` and `entity_category` (where required) are
set correctly before submitting a pull request.
